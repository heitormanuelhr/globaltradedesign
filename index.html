  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>
    Global Trade Design was built on more than 20 years of hands-on experience in international trade, supply chain design, and cross-border market development.</p>
  <p>  
    We operate as trade architects, not intermediaries. Our role is to design, structure and execute international trade projects that are sustainable, compliant, and scalable.</p>
  <p>  
    With deep expertise in international regulations, logistics, procurement and market entry, we support companies across multiple industries by connecting buyers and sellers and managing the full commercial and operational process, from strategy to final delivery.
