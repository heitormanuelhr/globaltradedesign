<!-- ABOUT -->
<section>
  <h2>Trade Architects</h2>

  <p>
    Global Trade Design was built on more than 20 years of hands-on experience in international trade, supply chain design and cross-border market development.

    We operate as <strong>trade architects</strong>, not intermediaries. Our role is to design, structure and execute international trade projects that are sustainable, compliant and scalable.
